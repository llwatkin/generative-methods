				<h1>Experiment 4 - Infinite Worlds: Cosmecho - New Stars</h1>

					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						Cosmecho is an exploration of creativity and novelty
						though a vast, infinite cosmos. In the New Stars
						version, each new world key creates a random set of new
						star types.<br>
						<br>Discover unique stars that have never been seen
						before and click on them to hear their signature sound.
						Combine the sounds of multiple stars to create an
						infinite, never-before-heard song.<br>
						<br>This ethereal virtual cosmos is unpredictable and
						impossible to fully experience. You can never know when
						you will find a certain type of star, and you don't know
						when—or if—you will ever find it again.<br>
						<br>Cosmecho invites you to explore the novelty of—and
						engage creatively with—the random stars you're dealt.
					</p>

					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>
						The core of the experiment lies in the unique hash value
						generated from the world key. Using the XXH32 hashing
						function and p5.js's built-in noiseSeed and randomSeed
						methods, each input generates a distinct visual output
						on a grid of tiles.<br>
						<br>Each tile, depending on its hashed value, displays a
						different predefined star texture and may possess a
						randomly generated star, one that can be activated or
						deactivated with a click.<br>
						<br>The technical architecture is designed to mimic
						infinite possibilities within a contained digital
						ecosystem, allowing each user's journey through the
						landscape to be unique and personal. The setup leverages
						JavaScript's flexibility and the p5.js library's
						graphical capabilities to render a responsive and
						interactive artistic piece.
					</p>
				</div>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I spent way too long on this one, but I'm very happy
						with how it turned out. I had a lot of trouble migrating
						my project to my portfolio and getting fullscreen to
						work, but finally seeing my stars on the big screen was
						a high point. Making the alternate versions was fun, and
						I'm surprised they turned out as varied as they did.
						It's hard to pick which one I prefer, which is
						surprising because I assumed I would prefer the first
						one I made based on our real universe.
