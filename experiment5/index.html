					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						This experiment is an evolutionary generator that
						attempts to best replicate a set of Rorschach inkbots.
						Along the way, it generates entirely new inkblot-looking
						images!
					</p>

					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>
						We draw a couple hundred black and white ellipses on
						half of the canvas, mirroring them on the other half.
						Every frame, their size, position, and rotation is
						randomized. Each time, the resultant image is compared
						to the inspiration, generating a score. If this score is
						better than the best score, a new image is saved as the
						best one.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						Me: I felt that Jack and I were able to contribute
						equally, and that Glitch made this a lot easier than it
						otherwise would have been. We were able to watch each
						other's changes in real-time and rapidly iterate on our
						generator without needing to worry about version
						control. My idea to switch to Rorschach ink blots and
						mirror the canvas was a big turning point, but that
						would never have come up if Jack hadn't mentioned
						Rorschach tests earlier in our process.<br>
						<br>
						Jack: I felt like Lyle and I were able to work
						simultaneously a lot and it helped make the project come
						together really quickly into a form that both of us were
						really proud of. I found it was really easy to suggest
						new ideas and get into a smooth workflow together that
						made for a really enriching experience all around. Lyle
						did an excellent job with digging into the nitty gritty
						of how we were going to approach the overall generation,
						and I was able to help bugfix and suggest and program
						ways of tuning the implementation because we used Glitch
						to code simultaneously.
