					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>
						A random pond generator, complete with animated fish
						that swim around. It was based on this image.<br>
						<br>
						<img
							src="assets/pond.jpg"
							width="400px"
						>
						<br>
						<br>
						<b>Color</b>
						<br>The pebble, lily pad, leaf, and fish colors were
						grabbed from the inspiring image.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Primitives</b>
						<br>The pebbles were rendered with circle(), the lily
						pads with arc(). The fish eyes and one set of fins are
						rendered with ellipse(). Their dorsal and tail fins are
						rendered with triangle().<br>
						<br>
						<b>Polygons</b>
						<br>The fish's bodies, one set of their fins, and the
						leaves surrounding the pond are built with bezier
						curves.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Composition</b>
						<br>Random seed values influence the number, position,
						and rotation of leaves and lilypads, as well as the
						position and sizes of the pebbles on the bottom. The
						number, sizes, colors, and positions of the fish are
						also randomized.<br>
						<br>
						<b>Life</b>
						<br>The leaves sway with the wind using noise(), the
						fish swim around following a modified version of the
						boids algorithm and their tails and dorsal fins move
						according to their speed. Additionally, the lily pads
						float up and down, leaving subtle ripples on the water.

					<h2>Technical</h2>
					<p>
						The pond is created bottom-up with a mix of immediate
						and retained graphics. The pebbles, for example, are
						drawn to a graphics layer only when a new pond is
						generated, then an image of them is drawn every frame.
						The animated elements all make use of p5.js's default
						immediate graphics. Each time the generate button is
						clicked, the random seed is incremented, resulting in a
						new pond. The fish algorithm is a modified version of <a
							href="https://p5js.org/examples/classes-and-objects-flocking/"
						>this p5.js boids example</a>.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>
						I followed a particularly iterative process with this
						experiment, gradually building upon elements and adding
						complexity and visual depth as I went. This made adding
						every feature seem easier and more approachable, as I
						could break it down into smaller steps, but also made it
						easier to give in to scope creep. I initially came into
						this with the idea to have a static environment, but
						with swimming fish as the element of life. That turned
						into adding animation to their tails, then animation to
						every environment element, and then adding shadows, and
						so on. I am very happy with the outcome, but I wish I
						could have finished by the deadline.
